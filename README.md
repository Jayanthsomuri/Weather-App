#Weather App
Overview
The Weather App is a web-based application that provides real-time weather information for any location worldwide. Using an external weather API, the app allows users to input any location (city or state) and view the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecasts. The app also integrates geolocation services to allow users to get the weather for their current location.
